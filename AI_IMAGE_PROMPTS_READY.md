## Tips for Best Results

### Ideogram (FREE)
- Works great with these prompts as-is
- Remove `--ar 16:9` (use aspect ratio dropdown instead)
- Select "16:9" from the aspect ratio options
- Use "Realistic" or "Design" style

### Midjourney
- Keep `--ar 16:9` at the end
- Add `--v 6` for latest model
- Add `--style raw` for cleaner results
- Example: `[prompt] --ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw`

### DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT Plus)
- Remove `--ar 16:9`
- Say "Create a 16:9 landscape image" at the start
- Works but may add unwanted text
