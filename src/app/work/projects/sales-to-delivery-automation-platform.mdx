## Executive Business Problem

Growing companies lose operational consistency when revenue closes faster than operations can execute.

Sales closes a deal → operations manually recreates scope → details are missed → fulfillment delays occur. This creates friction, rework, and revenue risk.

## What Was Broken - In Business Terms

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Manual project setup after every sale
- Inconsistent task creation
- No enforcement of execution standards

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- No structured handoff between revenue and delivery
- Execution dependent on memory and human interpretation
- No link between what was sold and what got delivered
- No per-deal profitability visibility

</Column>
</Grid>

## The System I Built

A **transaction-triggered operational automation engine** that:

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Detects confirmed revenue events
- Automatically generates structured execution records
- Creates standardized task sequences
- Selects execution templates based on engagement type - different deal types generate different task structures automatically
- Generates tasks from invoice line items - the services on the order define the execution plan

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Assigns accountability
- Enforces workflow stages
- Prevents progression without required completion
- Blocks confirmation unless a required trigger product is on the order - hard stop, not a warning
- Merges fragmented project records into a single workspace - one deal, one project
- Computes per-engagement margin automatically - client revenue, vendor costs, variance, and margin percentage on every project

</Column>
</Grid>

## How It Works

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

### 1. Trigger
Sales transaction reaches confirmed state
- **Client-facing quote acceptance** - Digital acknowledgment workflow with initials capture and acceptance timestamp

### 2. Generate
System auto-creates execution project
- **Auto-generated transaction identifiers** - Unique IDs created on record entry for end-to-end traceability
- **Analytic distribution linking** - Financial tracking accounts auto-assigned from sales record to project for downstream reporting
- **Workspace consolidation** - Detects and merges duplicate project records into one

### 3. Structure
Task framework generated from engagement-type templates and invoice line items
- **Structured service intake** - Tiered pricing model (multiple service levels) with quantity, hours, unit price, and computed subtotals at the pipeline level
- **Pre-delivery cost estimation** - Vendor cost projections captured before commitment, with estimated margin and margin percentage computed automatically
- **Order line validation** - Minimum threshold enforcement and price range checks per service variant before quote finalization

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

### 4. Assign
Roles cascade automatically across four business objects
- **4-object role cascade** - Account owner assignments propagate from customer record → pipeline → sales quote → execution project with no manual re-entry
- **65+ field bidirectional sync** - Data flows across CRM, Sales, Contacts, and Project modules with changes reflected in real time

### 5. Enforce
Pipeline stages advance automatically on business events
- **Pipeline stage automation** - Stages advance on business events (quote sent, order confirmed, project created) with full audit trail
- **11 transaction classifications** with revision tracking
- **Confirmation gate** - Blocks deal closure without execution trigger product

### 6. Track
Completion is tracked through structured state transitions
- **3-tier intake structure** - Identity and logistics, service configuration, financial estimates
- **725+ lines** of pipeline automation logic
- **1,108+ lines** of project and execution model code
- **Live margin computation** - Revenue, costs, variance, and margin percentage per engagement

</Column>
</Grid>

## Business Impact

<Grid columns="3" gap="m" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- **Instant** revenue-to-operations handoff
- **Zero** manual setup or re-entry

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- **Standardized** execution every time
- **Reduced** onboarding time

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- **Reduced** operational errors
- **Increased** delivery predictability
- **Real-time** per-engagement margin visibility
- **What's sold is what gets delivered** - scope drives execution

</Column>
</Grid>

## End Result

The company scales revenue without scaling chaos. Execution becomes **system-driven**, not person-dependent.
