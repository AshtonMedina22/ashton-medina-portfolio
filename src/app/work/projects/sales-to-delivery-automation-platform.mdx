*Eliminating the most expensive bottleneck in the business: the gap between "sold" and "started."*

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Problem

Sales closes a deal. Then operations spends hours rebuilding it—re-entering client details, creating task lists from scratch, assigning team members, chasing requirements that were already captured in the CRM. Every handoff is a chance to lose details, delay delivery, or misquote scope.

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Solution

A 6-phase automation chain that fires on order confirmation. Validates structure, creates CRM linkage, generates service-specific task templates, consolidates records, syncs 65+ fields bidirectionally, and automates stage progression with audit entries.

## Technical Implementation

- **Phase 1:** Order validation and kickoff line item enforcement
- **Phase 2:** CRM opportunity creation with 6 core event field mapping
- **Phase 3:** Service-specific task tree generation from templates
- **Phase 4:** Record consolidation preventing native ERP fragmentation
- **Phase 5:** 65+ field bidirectional sync across CRM, Sales, Contacts, Projects
- **Phase 6:** Stage automation (Quote → Proposal → Contract → Booked) with audit logging

</Column>
