*Eliminating manual project setup by automating the handoff from sales to delivery.*

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Challenge

Sales and delivery operated in disconnected systems. Teams created projects inconsistently, missed critical tasks, and re-entered the same data repeatedly—causing delays and quality issues.

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Solution

An automation platform that transforms confirmed transactions into fully structured execution projects. One trigger generates the project, tasks, assignments, and data propagation—zero manual setup required.

</Column>
</Grid>

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth marginTop="l">
<Column fillWidth>

## How It Works

- **Transaction confirmed** → automation trigger fires
- **Project created** with standardized structure from templates
- **Tasks generated** automatically based on project type
- **Data propagated** from quote to project (no re-entry)
- **Pipeline synced** to reflect execution readiness

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## Results

- **100% consistency** in project structure across engagements
- **Zero manual setup** time for new projects
- **Eliminated data re-entry** errors
- **Real-time pipeline accuracy** through automated sync
- **Reduced operational risk** with deterministic workflows
