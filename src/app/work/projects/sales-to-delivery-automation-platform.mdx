## Problem

Sales closes a deal. Then operations spends hours rebuilding it—re-entering client details, creating task lists from scratch, assigning team members, chasing requirements already captured in the CRM. Every handoff is a chance to lose details, delay delivery, or misquote scope. The gap between "sold" and "started" was the most expensive bottleneck in the business.

## How It Works

<HowItWorksGrid>
<HowItWorksCard title="Order Validation">
Validates order structure on confirmation. Blocks malformed records before any downstream automation runs.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="CRM Linkage">
Creates or links the opportunity and maps core deal fields. Establishes the canonical record all downstream objects reference.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Project Generation">
Triggers task template copy per service line. Each product spawns its own task tree with subtasks scoped to what was sold.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Task Consolidation">
Merges all generated tasks into one project. Eliminates record fragmentation native ERP flows create on multi-service orders.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Data Sync Engine">
Syncs 65+ fields bidirectionally across CRM, Sales Orders, Contacts, and Projects. Reporting stays consistent across all four objects.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Stage Automation">
Drives CRM stage progression on key deal milestones. Each transition logs a timestamped audit entry to the record thread.
</HowItWorksCard>
</HowItWorksGrid>

## Outcome

Confirming a sale auto-generates a scoped project, inherits all client requirements from CRM, and maintains full traceability from first contact to close.
