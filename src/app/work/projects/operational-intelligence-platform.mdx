## Problem

Business data lived in silos—sales metrics in CRM, project timelines in the PM tool, vendor costs in procurement, revenue in accounting. A unified performance view meant exporting CSVs, building pivot tables, and emailing spreadsheets. Reports were stale before they were assembled. When a number looked wrong, leadership couldn't drill in—they had to request another report and wait.

## How It Works

<HowItWorksGrid>
<HowItWorksCard title="Cross-Module Aggregation">
CRM, Sales, Projects, Vendor Management, and Accounting queried through a single data layer. No manual exports, no stale imports — one unified query surface across all five modules.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="ORM-Level Computation">
Metrics computed at the database layer using dynamic domain filtering. Performance stays consistent regardless of data volume — no client-side number crunching.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Seven Purpose-Built Views">
Personal tasks, team workload, upcoming engagements, pipeline health, vendor operations, revenue metrics, and a fully customizable canvas — each scoped to its operational domain.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="7+ Interactive Chart Types">
Line, bar, doughnut, pie, radar, scatter, and geographic map visualizations powered by AmCharts 5. Clicking any KPI tile or chart segment drills directly into the underlying live business records.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Drag-and-Drop Layout">
Widgets repositioned freely via GridStack.js. Layout, filters, and widget configuration saved independently per user — each role owns their own view.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Date Range & Filter Presets">
Saved filter presets allow instant time-window switching without rebuilding reports. All widgets query live operational data on every load.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Scheduled Intelligence Delivery">
Dashboards auto-email chart snapshots to defined recipients on a recurring schedule. Leadership receives operational intelligence without logging in.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="3-Format Export Engine">
One-click export to PDF via html2canvas and jsPDF, Excel via xlsxwriter, and PNG for presentations. Outputs formatted for executive consumption without manual formatting.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Modular & Migration-Safe Architecture">
New KPI widgets added without modifying core infrastructure. Automated migration scripts handle security rule and data structure updates on every module upgrade. Full test coverage for data integrity and access control.
</HowItWorksCard>
</HowItWorksGrid>

## Outcome

Leadership operates with real-time operational intelligence—configurable by role, exportable on demand, and delivered on schedule without anyone logging in.
