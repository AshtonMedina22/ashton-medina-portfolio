*Replacing the spreadsheet-and-email reporting cycle with click-through analytics.*

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>

## The Problem

Business data lived in silos—sales metrics in the CRM, project timelines in the PM tool, vendor costs in procurement, revenue in accounting. Getting a unified performance view meant exporting CSVs, building pivot tables, and emailing spreadsheets. When an executive saw a concerning number, they couldn't drill in—they had to request another report and wait.

## The Solution

A dashboard platform with GridStack.js drag-and-drop layout and AmCharts 5 visualization. Each widget is interactive: clicking a KPI tile or chart segment drills directly into the underlying business records, not a static view. Per-user layout persistence lets each role configure their own dashboard.

</Grid>

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth marginTop="l">
<Column fillWidth>

## Technical Implementation

- **7+ chart types:** line, bar, doughnut, pie, radar, scatter, map
- **ORM-level aggregation:** dynamic domain filtering across modules
- **Drag-and-drop layouts:** GridStack.js with per-user persistence
- **Click-through to live records:** not static views, actual business objects
- **Date range filtering:** saved filter presets without new report builds
- **Cross-module aggregation:** CRM, Sales, Project, Vendor, Accounting in single query layer

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## Results

- **3 export formats:** PDF (html2canvas + jsPDF), Excel (xlsxwriter), PNG
- **Per-user dashboards:** role-configurable views with saved layouts
- **Real-time data:** rendering against live operational records
- **Board-ready reports:** one-click exports for presentations
- **4,600+ lines** of dashboard logic

</Column>
</Grid>
