*Turning fragmented operational data into real-time, actionable intelligence.*

## The Challenge

Business leaders made reactive decisions because operational data was scattered across systems. There was no unified view of readiness, profitability, or performance—issues impacted delivery before anyone noticed.

## The Solution

An analytics platform that aggregates data from all business systems and computes real-time KPIs. Role-aware dashboards surface the right metrics to the right people with drill-down capabilities.

## How It Works

- **Data aggregated** from all operational systems
- **KPIs computed** in real-time (profitability, readiness, workload)
- **Role filtering** ensures relevant metrics per user
- **Dashboards display** KPI cards with drill-down
- **Alerts trigger** when thresholds are breached

## Results

- **Real-time visibility** with sub-minute metric updates
- **Proactive issue detection** through automated alerts
- **Better decisions** with accurate, role-appropriate data
- **Improved resource allocation** via workload analysis
- **Profitability optimization** through margin tracking
