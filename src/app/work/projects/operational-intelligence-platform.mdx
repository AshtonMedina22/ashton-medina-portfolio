## Problem Context

Operational data exists across multiple systems but is rarely aggregated into actionable metrics. Leaders lack real-time visibility into readiness, margin, workload, and performance, making it difficult to make data-driven decisions and identify operational issues before they impact delivery.

Without aggregated intelligence, organizations face:
- Fragmented data across CRM, execution, and vendor systems
- Manual metric calculation leading to delays and errors
- Lack of role-appropriate visibility into operational health
- Inability to identify margin opportunities and workload imbalances
- Reactive decision-making instead of proactive operational management

## Solution Overview

This platform computes cross-domain metrics and exposes them through role-aware dashboards. The system aggregates operational records, computes derived KPIs, and provides role-filtered views with drill-down capabilities—enabling executives and operational teams to make informed decisions based on real-time operational intelligence.

## Analytics Model

The platform implements a sophisticated data pipeline:

**Operational Records** → Aggregation Queries → Computed KPI Fields → Derived Metrics → Role-Filtered Views → Dashboard Cards + Drilldown Views

This pipeline ensures real-time metric calculation with proper data transformation and role-based access control.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Domain Aggregation**: Aggregates operational metrics across multiple modules and systems with real-time synchronization
- **Computed KPIs**: Derives key performance indicators from raw operational data with optimized calculation engines
- **Role-Filtered Views**: Provides role-aware dashboard views showing relevant metrics for each user with proper access control
- **Drill-Down Reporting**: Supports detailed analysis with drill-down query views enabling root cause analysis
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Surfaces readiness and margin indicators with up-to-date calculations and caching
- **Executive Dashboards**: Enables operational visibility at the leadership level with high-level KPIs and trends

## Technical Implementation

### Engineering Patterns

The platform implements sophisticated analytics patterns:

- **Computed KPI models** with derived metric fields calculated on-demand or pre-computed for performance
- **Aggregation queries across domains** combining data from multiple sources with proper joins and filtering
- **Singleton dashboard engine pattern** for consistent metric calculation and caching across all views
- **Domain-filtered metrics** ensuring role-appropriate data access with field-level permissions
- **Derived margin calculations** from operational records with cost and revenue aggregation
- **Timeline readiness metrics** tracking project and event readiness with milestone tracking
- **Task workload metrics** measuring team capacity and utilization with resource allocation analysis
- **Drill-down query views** enabling detailed analysis with nested aggregation and filtering
- **Multi-source aggregation** combining data from CRM, execution, and vendor systems with data transformation

### Dashboard Capabilities

The platform provides comprehensive dashboard functionality:

- **KPI cards** with real-time updates and trend indicators
- **Role-filtered views** showing metrics relevant to each user's role and permissions
- **Rep-level performance** tracking individual and team performance metrics
