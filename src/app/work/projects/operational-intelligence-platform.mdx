## The Problem

Leadership cannot manage what it cannot see: data trapped in operational systems, no aggregated KPIs, no role-filtered reporting, and reactive decisions.

---

## The System

A **cross-system aggregation and KPI computation engine** that:

<SectionCard>
<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<AccentColumn accent="red">

- Consolidates operational metrics
- Computes performance indicators

</AccentColumn>
<AccentColumn accent="cyan">

- Filters visibility by role
- Surfaces revenue, readiness, workload, and status metrics
- Delivers scheduled intelligence via email — dashboards auto-send chart snapshots to defined recipients on a recurring schedule without anyone logging in

</AccentColumn>
</Grid>

## How It Works

<SectionCard>

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<AccentColumn accent="red">

### 1. Aggregate
System pulls data from CRM, Sales, Projects, Vendor Management, and Accounting through a unified query layer

- **Cross-module aggregation** — Five operational modules queried through a single data layer with no manual data exports or imports
- **Seven purpose-built views** — Personal tasks, team workload, upcoming engagements, pipeline health, vendor operations, revenue metrics, and a customizable canvas
- **Unified engagement calendar** — Pulls upcoming engagements from both the sales pipeline and the project module into a single calendar view
- **ORM-level computation** — Dynamic domain filtering computes metrics at the database layer for performance

### 2. Visualize
Metrics are rendered through interactive, configurable chart components

- **7+ chart types** — Line, bar, doughnut, pie, radar, scatter, and geographic map visualizations powered by AmCharts 5
- **Interactive drill-through** — Clicking any KPI tile or chart segment navigates directly to the underlying business records
- **Drag-and-drop layout** — Dashboard widgets repositioned freely via GridStack.js with layout saved per user
- **Date range filtering** — Saved filter presets allow instant time-window switching without rebuilding reports

</AccentColumn>
<AccentColumn accent="cyan">

### 3. Filter
Role permissions determine dashboard visibility with personalized configurations

- **Per-user dashboards** — Each role configures their own view with widgets, layout, and filters saved independently
- **Real-time rendering** — All widgets query live operational data on load

### 4. Export
One-click reporting formatted for executive consumption

- **3 export formats** — PDF (html2canvas + jsPDF), Excel (xlsxwriter), PNG snapshots
- **Board-ready output** — Exports formatted for executive presentations without manual formatting
- **Scheduled email delivery** — Dashboards auto-email chart snapshots to a recipient list on a recurring schedule

### Platform Scale

- **4,600+ lines** of dashboard logic across models, views, and client-side rendering
- **Migration-safe architecture** — Automated migration scripts update security rules and data structures on module upgrade
- **Full test coverage** — Dedicated test suite for dashboard data integrity and access control validation
- **Modular widget system** — New KPI widgets added without modifying core dashboard infrastructure
