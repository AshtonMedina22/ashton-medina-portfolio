## Executive Business Problem

Leadership cannot manage what it cannot see.

Without structured operational visibility:

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Bottlenecks go undetected
- Workload imbalance persists

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Profitability trends are unclear
- Decisions are reactive

</Column>
</Grid>

---

## What Was Broken

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Data trapped inside operational systems
- No aggregated KPI visibility

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- No role-filtered reporting
- No executive-level summaries

</Column>
</Grid>

## The System I Built

A **cross-system aggregation and KPI computation engine** that:

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Consolidates operational metrics
- Computes performance indicators

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Filters visibility by role
- Surfaces revenue, readiness, workload, and status metrics
- Delivers scheduled intelligence via email - dashboards auto-send chart snapshots to defined recipients on a recurring schedule without anyone logging in

</Column>
</Grid>

## How It Works

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

### 1. Aggregate
System pulls data from CRM, Sales, Projects, Vendor Management, and Accounting through a unified query layer
- **Cross-module aggregation** - Five operational modules queried through a single data layer with no manual data exports or imports
- **Seven purpose-built views** - Personal tasks, team workload, upcoming engagements, pipeline health, vendor operations, revenue metrics, and a customizable canvas. Each surfaces only the data relevant to that function
- **Unified engagement calendar** - Pulls upcoming engagements from both the sales pipeline and the project module into a single calendar view, regardless of which module owns the record
- **ORM-level computation** - Dynamic domain filtering computes metrics at the database layer for performance, not in application code

### 2. Visualize
Metrics are rendered through interactive, configurable chart components
- **7+ chart types** - Line, bar, doughnut, pie, radar, scatter, and geographic map visualizations powered by AmCharts 5
- **Interactive drill-through** - Clicking any KPI tile or chart segment navigates directly to the underlying business records, not a filtered view
- **Drag-and-drop layout** - Dashboard widgets repositioned freely via GridStack.js with layout saved per user for persistent personalization
- **Date range filtering** - Saved filter presets allow instant time-window switching without rebuilding reports

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

### 3. Filter
Role permissions determine dashboard visibility with personalized configurations
- **Per-user dashboards** - Each role configures their own view with widgets, layout, and filters saved independently
- **Real-time rendering** - All widgets query live operational data on load, ensuring dashboards always reflect current state

### 4. Export
One-click reporting formatted for executive consumption
- **3 export formats** - PDF generation (html2canvas + jsPDF), Excel workbooks (xlsxwriter), and PNG image snapshots
- **Board-ready output** - Exports formatted for executive presentations without manual formatting
- **Scheduled email delivery** - Dashboards configured to auto-email chart snapshots to a recipient list on a recurring schedule. Executives receive summaries in their inbox

### Platform Scale
- **4,600+ lines** of dashboard logic across models, views, and client-side rendering
- **Migration-safe architecture** - Automated migration scripts update security rules and data structures on module upgrade
- **Full test coverage** - Dedicated test suite for dashboard data integrity and access control validation
- **Modular widget system** - New KPI widgets added without modifying core dashboard infrastructure

</Column>
</Grid>
