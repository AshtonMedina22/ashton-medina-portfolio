## Problem

Vendor relationships lacked structure—informal onboarding, no enforced compliance checkpoints, manual approval tracking, and zero visibility into performance or spend. Work orders went out as email attachments, confirmations were verbal, and quote comparisons lived in spreadsheets. Internal teams had no real-time view of vendor status and every engagement required manual coordination from application through delivery.

## How It Works

<HowItWorksGrid>
<HowItWorksCard title="Public Application Intake">
Vendors apply through a public-facing portal, upload required documents, and enter the onboarding pipeline directly. No staff intermediary required to initiate the relationship.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Tokenized Portal Access">
Time-limited tokens give vendors secure access to assignments, tasks, quotes, and messaging without login credentials. 15 governed routes control exactly what they can see and do.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Record-Level Isolation">
Each vendor sees only their own data. Customer pricing, margins, and other vendor records are blocked at the ORM layer — enforced in code, not policy.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Work Order Lifecycle">
A 6-state workflow manages every assignment: Pending → Sent → Confirmed → Declined → In Progress → Completed. Vendors accept with e-signature, decline with a reason, and post messages directly to internal teams.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="RFQ & Quote Engine">
Multiple vendors submit competing quotes against the same scope through the portal. Deadlines auto-close, a selection wizard picks the winner, remaining bids close automatically, and a purchase order generates from the winning quote.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Compliance Monitoring">
Documents tracked across 15+ service categories with a 3-tier vendor classification system. Scheduled jobs flag expiry at 30 days, 7 days, and on the expiration date — per vendor record.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Batch Reminder Engine">
A cron job processes 200 records per cycle and auto-sends follow-ups for assignments pending over 24 hours. No manual chasing by internal staff.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Internal Staff Visibility">
Internal teams have a full cross-vendor view: real-time response status, compliance standing, document expiry, portal dashboard counters, and cost variance (estimated vs. actual) aggregated at the project level.
</HowItWorksCard>

<HowItWorksCard title="Performance & Rate Governance">
Per-vendor, per-service rate cards control pricing structures. Post-delivery 1–5 ratings capture performance history. Financial accountability is measurable across every engagement.
</HowItWorksCard>
</HowItWorksGrid>

## Outcome

Vendor relationships become controlled, measurable, and auditable — vendors self-serve from application through delivery while internal teams maintain complete visibility without touching an inbox.
