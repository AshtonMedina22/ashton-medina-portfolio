*Replacing email chains with an auditable, governed vendor workflow.*

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Problem

Vendor coordination ran on email and phone calls. Work orders were sent as attachments, confirmations were verbal, quote comparisons lived in spreadsheets, and compliance documents were scattered across inboxes. A single missed confirmation could derail an entire event.

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## The Solution

A 15-route vendor portal with tokenized access links (48-hour expiry), 6-state work order lifecycle, automated RFQ workflows with best-quote selection, and record-level data isolation enforced at the ORM layer.

</Grid>

<Column fillWidth>

## Technical Implementation

- **6-state lifecycle:** Pending → Sent → Confirmed → Declined → In Progress → Completed
- **Tokenized access:** No login credentials, 48-hour expiry for security
- **Record-level isolation:** Each vendor sees only their assignments—no customer pricing, no other vendors, no margin data
- **RFQ automation:** Multiple vendors submit quotes, auto-close deadlines, cron-selected best quote
- **Compliance tracking:** 15+ service categories, 3-tier classification, automated expiry monitoring
- **Batch reminders:** 200 records/cycle cron job for 24-hour pending work orders

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

## Results

- **15 secure routes** with governed portal access
- **E-signature accept/decline** with reason capture
- **Real-time vendor response tracking** for internal teams
- **Cost variance reporting:** estimated vs. actual
- **Automated document expiry alerts** across all vendors
- **1,460+ lines of Python** across portal controllers and assignment models
