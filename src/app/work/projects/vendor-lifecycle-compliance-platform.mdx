## Executive Business Problem

Companies working with vendors or contractors often lack structured control over:

<Grid columns="3" gap="m" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Onboarding
- Documentation

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Approval chains
- Quote validation

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Ongoing compliance

</Column>
</Grid>

This leads to financial risk and operational inconsistency.

## What Was Broken

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Informal vendor onboarding
- Manual approval tracking
- No structured quote comparison

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- No enforced compliance checkpoints
- Limited visibility into vendor performance
- No way for vendors to apply or respond to assignments without staff manually relaying information
- Document expiration tracked manually or not at all

</Column>
</Grid>

## The System I Built

A **controlled vendor management platform** that:

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

- Formalizes onboarding steps
- Enforces approval chains
- Tracks vendor lifecycle stages
- Public-facing vendor application portal - vendors apply, upload documents, and enter the onboarding pipeline directly

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

- Manages structured quote comparison
- Applies role-based access control
- Logs financial and compliance states
- Vendor self-service for assignments - vendors accept/decline work orders through a secure portal with e-signature, no staff intermediary
- Automated expiry monitoring - scheduled jobs flag documents at 30 days, 7 days, and on expiration date

</Column>
</Grid>

---

## How It Works

<Grid columns="2" gap="l" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>

### 1. Onboard
Vendor enters onboarding state with required documentation enforced
- **Vendor tiering** - Multi-level classification system for segmenting vendor capabilities and service authorization
- **15 secure routes** - Work orders, tasks, upcoming engagements, quote submissions, and messaging all accessible through a governed portal
- **Tokenized access links** - Time-limited tokens allow vendors to view and respond to assignments without login credentials
- **Public application intake** - Vendors submit company details and upload required documents (insurance, certifications, licenses) through a web form. Applications enter the onboarding pipeline with tracked status

### 2. Document
Compliance documents tracked with 4-state monitoring
- **4-state compliance monitoring** - Scheduled jobs automatically scan all vendor documents and flag at 30 days before expiry, 7 days before expiry, and on expiration date. Status computed per vendor record
- **Portal dashboard counters** - Real-time counts for pending assignments, active work, upcoming engagements, open tasks, and quote requests

### 3. Approve
Approval chain validates engagement
- **E-signature workflow** - Contract requests auto-generated on assignment send, with signature date tracking and decline reason capture
- **Record-level data isolation** - Each vendor sees only their own assignments at the ORM layer, with no access to pricing, margins, or other vendor data

</Column>
<Column fillWidth>

### 4. Compare
Structured RFQ workflow allows multiple vendors to submit quotes
- **RFQ auto-close** - Quote request deadlines enforced automatically with best-quote selection logic
- **Batch reminder engine** - Scheduled job processes 200 records per cycle, auto-sending follow-ups for pending assignments
- **Portal quote submission** - Vendors submit quotes through the portal. Manager selects winner via selection wizard, system auto-closes remaining bids, and generates a purchase order from the winning quote

### 5. Activate
6-state lifecycle controls activation - Pending, Sent, Confirmed, Declined, In Progress, Completed
- **Task-to-assignment linking** - Each work order has linked task records with progress tracking displayed as completion ratios
- **Scheduled start/end tracking** - Time-bound assignments with arrival time and delivery window enforcement

### 6. Govern
Financial interactions governed through service-specific rate cards
- **Service rate cards** - Per-vendor, per-service pricing structures with rate descriptions and notes
- **Cost variance reporting** - Estimated vs. actual cost computed per assignment, aggregated at the project level for budget tracking
- **Post-delivery performance rating** - 1-5 rating system captured after each completed assignment

</Column>
</Grid>

## Business Impact

<Grid columns="3" gap="m" fillWidth>
<Column fillWidth>
