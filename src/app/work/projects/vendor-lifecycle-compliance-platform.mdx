*Formalizing external partner engagement with secure portals and automated compliance.*

## The Challenge

Partner coordination relied on email threads and informal confirmations. Assignments went unconfirmed, compliance documents expired unnoticed, and sensitive data became exposed—creating compliance gaps and accountability issues.

## The Solution

A platform that formalizes partner engagement through structured lifecycles, secure portal access, and automated compliance controls. Partners interact through token-scoped portals with complete audit trails.

## How It Works

- **Partner approved** → assignment created
- **Work order issued** → portal access granted
- **Partner accepts/declines** via secure portal
- **Compliance tracked** with automated expiry alerts
- **Quote comparison** for multi-partner requests

## Results

- **100% confirmation** on all partner assignments
- **Zero compliance lapses** with automated monitoring
- **Complete audit trails** for every partner interaction
- **Full data isolation** protecting customer information
- **Faster partner responses** through automated reminders
