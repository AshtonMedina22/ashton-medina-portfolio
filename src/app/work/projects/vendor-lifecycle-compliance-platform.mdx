## Problem Context

Businesses managing external partners face significant risk when coordination relies on email threads and informal confirmations. Partner assignments go unconfirmed, compliance documents expire unnoticed, and sensitive customer data becomes exposed—creating compliance gaps, accountability issues, and execution delays that impact business operations across all industries.

## Solution Overview

A comprehensive platform that formalizes external partner engagement through a structured lifecycle with secure portal access and automated compliance controls. The system provides secure partner portals, issues structured work orders, tracks compliance documents with automated alerts, and supports multi-partner quote comparison—all while maintaining strict data isolation and security boundaries. Applicable to vendors, suppliers, contractors, freelancers, and any external business relationships.

## Partner Workflow

**Standard Flow**: Partner Approved → Assignment Created → Work Order Issued → Portal Access → Accept/Decline → Execution Tasks → Completion

**Quote Comparison Flow**: Quote Request Issued → Multiple Quotes → Comparison → Best Quote Selected → Purchase Order → Standard Flow Continues

## Key Features

- **Secure Partner Portal**: Token-scoped access with external user isolation and partner-only record visibility
- **Structured Work Orders**: Formal work orders with accept/decline capture and audit trails

## Business Impact
