# Image Creation Plan Review & Recommendations

## 📊 YOUR PLAN SUMMARY

**Total Images Needed: 15**
- 3 Project Card Images (shown on `/work` page)
- 12 Project Detail Images (4 per project, shown in carousel on detail pages)

**Your 5-Step Plan:**
1. **3 Base Mockup Templates** (Canva) - 10 min
2. **3 Project Card Images** (Canva) - 15 min  
3. **3 Workflow Diagrams** (Canva) - 20 min
4. **3 Architecture Diagrams** (Canva) - 20 min
5. **3 Mock Screens** (Canva) - 30 min

**Total Estimated Time: ~95 minutes**

## ✅ WHAT YOU NEED TO CREATE IN CANVA/BUILDER.IO

### **ALL 15 IMAGES** - Manual Creation Required

**Why?** These are visual design assets that require:
- Professional UI mockups
- Custom branding/styling
- Specific content matching your projects
- Design consistency across portfolio

**Tools Recommended:**
- **Canva** (easier, faster, templates available) ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- **Builder.io** (more complex, better for interactive)
- **Figma** (if you want more control)

## 🎯 DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### STEP 1: Base Mockup Templates (Canva) ✅ **MANUAL**

**What to Create:**
- Template A: Execution Workspace Dashboard
- Template B: Vendor Portal Interface  
- Template C: KPI Dashboard

**Canva Search Terms:**
- "dashboard UI mockup"
- "admin dashboard template"
- "saas dashboard design"
- "web app interface"

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GOOD PLAN** - Creating base templates first is smart for consistency.

**Output:** 3 master templates (not exported yet, just saved as templates)

---

### STEP 2: Project Card Images (Canva) ✅ **MANUAL**

**What to Create:**
- From Template A → "Execution Workspace" title → Export as `sales-to-delivery-card.jpg`
- From Template B → "Vendor Portal" title → Export as `vendor-lifecycle-card.jpg`
- From Template C → "Operational Intelligence Dashboard" title → Export as `operational-intelligence-card.jpg`

**Specifications:**
- Size: **1600×1000px** (you specified) ✅
- Format: JPG
- **Note:** These are for project cards on `/work` page (first image in carousel)

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GOOD PLAN** - Simple modification of templates.

**Output:** 3 images (project card faces)

---

### STEP 3: Workflow/Lifecycle Diagrams (Canva) ✅ **MANUAL**

**What to Create:**
1. **Sales → Execution Flow** (for Sales-to-Delivery project)
   - Boxes: Lead → Quote → Confirmed Order → Automation Trigger → Execution Project → Tasks → Ready
   
2. **Vendor Lifecycle Flow** (for Vendor Compliance project)
   - Boxes: Approved Vendor → Assignment → Work Order → Portal Access → Accept/Decline → Execution → Completion
   
3. **KPI Aggregation Flow** (for Operational Intelligence project)
   - Boxes: Operational Records → Aggregation → Computed KPIs → Derived Metrics → Role Filter → Dashboard

**Canva Elements:**
- Search: "flowchart", "process diagram", "system flow"
- Use: Rectangle boxes + arrows
- Keep: 5-7 boxes max, large labels only

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GOOD PLAN** - Simple, clear diagrams work best.

**Output:** 3 workflow diagram images

---

### STEP 4: Architecture/Data Model Visuals (Canva) ✅ **MANUAL**

**What to Create:**
1. **Cross-Model Automation Architecture** (Sales-to-Delivery)
   - Layers: CRM Layer → Order Layer → Execution Layer → Output
   - Show: Domain models, data propagation, automation triggers
   
2. **Security Boundary Architecture** (Vendor Compliance)
   - Layers: Internal System → Security Boundary → External Portal → Vendor Access
   - Show: Token-scoped access, data isolation, RBAC
   
3. **Metric Aggregation Architecture** (Operational Intelligence)
   - Layers: Data Sources → Aggregation Engine → Computed Models → Dashboard Layer
   - Show: Multi-source data, KPI computation, role filtering

**Canva Elements:**
- Search: "system architecture", "data architecture", "network diagram"
- Use: Layered boxes, simple arrows
- Keep: Simple, not overcomplicated

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GOOD PLAN** - Architecture diagrams add technical credibility.

**Output:** 3 architecture diagram images

---

### STEP 5: Mock Screens (Canva) ✅ **MANUAL**

**What to Create:**
1. **Task Tree + Project Card Panels** (Sales-to-Delivery)
   - Duplicate Template A
   - Show: Task generation interface, project cards, execution workspace
   - Labels: "Task A", "Status", "Project", "Execution"
   
2. **Comparison Table + Status Badges** (Vendor Compliance)
   - Duplicate Template B
   - Show: RFQ comparison table, vendor status badges, compliance tracking
   - Labels: "Vendor A", "Status", "Quote", "Compliance"
   
3. **KPI Cards + Charts** (Operational Intelligence)
   - Duplicate Template C
   - Show: KPI cards, metrics charts, dashboard widgets
   - Labels: "Metric A", "Score", "Index", "Readiness", "Margin"

**Recommendation:** ✅ **GOOD PLAN** - Mock screens show UI/UX capabilities.

**Output:** 3 mock screen images

## ⚠️ WHAT CAN BE AUTOMATED? (Very Little)

### ❌ **CANNOT BE AUTOMATED:**
- UI mockups (require design skills)
- Workflow diagrams (require visual design)
- Architecture diagrams (require layout decisions)
- Mock screens (require UI/UX design)

### ✅ **COULD BE ASSISTED (but still manual):**
- **Mermaid diagrams** - Could generate code for workflow/architecture diagrams, but you'd still need to export as images
- **AI image generation** - Could use DALL-E/Midjourney for conceptual images, but won't match your specific project details
- **Template libraries** - Canva templates speed up creation, but you still need to customize

**Recommendation:** Stick with your Canva plan - it's the most efficient approach.

## 🎨 DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS

### Color Scheme
- Match your portfolio's color scheme (check `src/resources/once-ui.config.ts`)
- Use consistent colors across all 15 images
- Professional, clean palette

### Typography
- Use clear, readable fonts
- Large labels (as you specified)
- Consistent font family across all images

### Layout
- Keep it simple and clean
- White space is your friend
- Don't overcrowd with details

### Export Settings
- **Project Cards:** 1600×1000px JPG (as you specified)
- **Detail Images:** 1920×1080px JPG (16:9 for carousel)
- **Format:** JPG (optimized for web)
- **Quality:** High quality but web-optimized (under 500KB each)

---

## ✅ YOUR PLAN ASSESSMENT

### Strengths:
1. ✅ **Efficient workflow** - Base templates → variations
2. ✅ **Realistic time estimate** - ~95 minutes is achievable
3. ✅ **Clear structure** - Each step builds on previous
4. ✅ **Right tool choice** - Canva is perfect for this
5. ✅ **Correct image count** - 15 images matches requirements

### Suggestions:
1. **Consider:** Creating all 3 base templates FIRST, then batch-export all variations
2. **Consider:** Using Canva's "Brand Kit" to ensure color consistency
3. **Consider:** Saving templates as "Designs" in Canva for easy duplication
4. **Note:** Project card images (Step 2) will be the FIRST image in each project's carousel, so make them strong
